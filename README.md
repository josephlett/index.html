# A data science project portfolio should showcase your skills and experience in various data science techniques and technologies. Here are some possible requirements to include in your portfolio:



Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing: Include at least one project that demonstrates your ability to clean and pre-process data. This could involve removing duplicates, handling missing values, or transforming data into a different format.



Data Visualization: Showcase your skills in data visualization by including a project that demonstrates the use of tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly. This could involve creating visualizations that highlight trends or patterns in the data.



Exploratory Data Analysis: Include at least one project that demonstrates your ability to perform exploratory data analysis. This could involve summarizing key statistics of a dataset, identifying correlations between variables, or detecting anomalies.



Machine Learning: Showcase your skills in machine learning by including a project that demonstrates the use of popular ML algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, or Random Forest. This should illustrate your ability to choose appropriate algorithms based on the specific data science problem and to evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.



Big Data: If you have experience working with big data technologies such as Hadoop or Spark, include a project that showcases your skills in this area. This could involve analyzing large datasets, performing distributed computing, or scaling ML algorithms to handle big data.



Business Case: Finally, include a project that demonstrates your ability to apply data science techniques to solve a specific business problem. This should illustrate your ability to communicate effectively with stakeholders, to identify key business metrics, and to provide actionable insights based on your analysis.
